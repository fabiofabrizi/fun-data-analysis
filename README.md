# fun-data-analysis
Work from the 'Fundamentals of Data Analysis' module, 2nd Semester


## Week 2
Had to add a .gitignore file to the repo as it was created last week.
Followed the instructions [here on FreeCodeCamp.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/gitignore-what-is-it-and-how-to-add-to-repo/)


## Topic 2: Randomness
This topic explored randomness and it's role in statistics
The binomial function was covered and it's application in how to calculate the probability of a particular outcome.
The exercises included how to calculate the probability of a coin flip and the probability of a certain number of outcomes, i.e. 4 heads.
3 distributions were also plotted, with explanations:
- Standard Exponential distribution
- Weibull distribution
- Rayleigh distribution

## Topic 3: Bias

For this topic, types of bias were discussed.
For the exercises, 3 different types of cognitive bias were given, with explanations:
- Anchoring
- Bandwagon
- Stereotyping

The second exercise was to prove that the difference in standard deviation calculations is greatest for small sample sizes.

## Topic 4: Outliers

This topic dealt with outliers - definition of an outlier, how outliers can be seen best on different plots (box plots), etc.
The first exercise was to create box plots for all five experiments in the Morley data set;
The second exercise was to create box plots for all the numerical variables in Fisher's Iris data set.

## Topic 5: Cleansing
This topic dealt with cleaning data using Python, i.e. using Python regular expressions to format, extract or find data that is needed.
The first exercise was to remove all non-alphanumeric characters from a string;
The second exercise was to adapt the code from the lecture to capitalise the first letter of the iris species using regular expressions, after the species name is placed first.
