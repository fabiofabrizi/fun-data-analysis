# fun-data-analysis
Work from the 'Fundamentals of Data Analysis' module, 2nd Semester.


## Week 2
Had to add a .gitignore file to the repo as it was created last week.
Followed the instructions [here on FreeCodeCamp.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/gitignore-what-is-it-and-how-to-add-to-repo/)


## Topic 2: Randomness
This topic explored randomness and it's role in statistics.<br>
The binomial function was covered and it's application in how to calculate the probability of a particular outcome.<br>
The exercises included how to calculate the probability of a coin flip and the probability of a certain number of outcomes, i.e. 4 heads.<br>
3 distributions were also plotted, with explanations:
- Standard Exponential distribution
- Weibull distribution
- Rayleigh distribution

## Topic 3: Bias

For this topic, types of bias were discussed.<br>
For the exercises, 3 different types of cognitive bias were given, with explanations:
- Anchoring
- Bandwagon
- Stereotyping

The second exercise was to prove that the difference in standard deviation calculations is greatest for small sample sizes.

## Topic 4: Outliers

This topic dealt with outliers - definition of an outlier, how outliers can be seen best on different plots (box plots), etc.<br>
The first exercise was to create box plots for all five experiments in the Morley data set;<br>
The second exercise was to create box plots for all the numerical variables in Fisher's Iris data set.<br>

## Topic 5: Cleansing
This topic dealt with cleaning data using Python, i.e. using Python regular expressions to format, extract or find data that is needed.<br>
The first exercise was to remove all non-alphanumeric characters from a string;<br>
The second exercise was to adapt the code from the lecture to capitalise the first letter of the iris species using regular expressions, after the species name is placed first.<br>


## Project

The project for the module was to explore the normal distribution by creating a Jupyter notebook and exploring the concepts behind it.<br>
This can be found under the folder:<br>
/project<br>

The notebook starts with a brief explanation and definition of what a normal distribution is, before generating a sample normal distribution with numpy and then plotting it using matplotlib.<br>
A variable from a real dataset (Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset) was used to explore:<br>
- Basic statistics used for the normal distribution (mean, standard deviation)
- The empirical rule (including proof)
- Kurtosis 
- Skew
