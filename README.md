# fun-data-analysis
Work from the 'Fundamentals of Data Analysis' module, 2nd Semester


## Week 2
Had to add a .gitignore file to the repo as it was created last week.
Followed the instructions [here on FreeCodeCamp.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/gitignore-what-is-it-and-how-to-add-to-repo/)


## Topic 2: Randomness
This topic explored randomness and it's role in statistics
The binomial function was covered and it's application in how to calculate the probability of a particular outcome.
The exercises included how to calculate the probability of a coin flip and the probability of a certain number of outcomes, i.e. 4 heads.
3 distributions were also plotted, with explanations:
- Standard Exponential distribution
- Weibull distribution
- Rayleigh distribution

## Topic 3: Bias

For this topic, types of bias were discussed.
For the exercises, 3 different types of cognitive bias were given, with explanations:
- Anchoring
- Bandwagon
- Stereotyping
